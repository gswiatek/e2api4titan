Here are my preferences for further development:
------------------------------------------------

High:
- Support for web/services.m3u (e.g. to store the playlist in VLC)
- Direct implementation for movie list to support EPG.
- Transponder check for the E2 HTTP request web/serviceplayable
- Bug fixes
- Code improvements and checks (e.g. memory leaks)

Medium:
- IPK build

Low:
- Radio
- Cross-compilation for Raspberry Pi 

No priority:
- Web Basic Authentication
