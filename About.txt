This software allows you to use Enigma2 Apps on your iOS device
to connect to Sat receiver with Titan.

This software implements only a part of Enigma2 Web-API.
Each implemented E2 specific HTTP request will be translated to Titan specific call.
Answers from Titan are translated back to E2. 
Some E2 requests (e.g. bouquets, device information) are implemented directly.

The implemented web server should be started on the Sat receiver, but you can also
start it on some server (e.g. Raspberry Pi).

My test environment:
- Sat receiver: Atemio510 and UFS-910 (currently both with Titan 1.23)
- iOS device: iPad2
- iOS apps: 
	* dreaMote Lite (with BUZZ Player and GoodPlayer used for streaming)
	* Dreambox Live
